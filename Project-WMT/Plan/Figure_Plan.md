# GRL limitations

For GRL, the length limit is **12 publication units**, where 1 publication unit = 1 figure, 1 table, or 500 words. I would recommend 4-5 figures and 3500-4000 words.

# Summary

- **Figure 1:**
    - $\delta AMOC_{z}$ v.s $\delta WMT_{lab}$
    - Change in AMOC in depth space v.s. Change in WMT flux over the Labrador Sea
        - Over the full density bin?
- **Figure 2:**
    - Climatological WMT flux * 2 groups
        
    - Response in WMT flux *2 groups
        
    - $\delta WMT_{lab}$ v.s $WMT_{lab}$
        
        $\delta WMT_{ena}$ v.s $WMT_{ena}$
        
        - Change in the WMT flux versus the climatological WMT flux for **EACH region**
        - by this figure, we should know: the change in WMT is mainly driven by change in Heat flux component ($WMT_{T}$)
    - Split into T and S-driven?
        
        - $\delta WMT_{lab}$ v.s $WMT_{lab, T\;or\;S}$
            - $\delta WMT_{lab,T}$ v.s $WMT_{lab, T\;or\;S}$
        - $\delta WMT_{ena}$ v.s $WMT_{ena,T\;or\;S}$
- **Figure 3:**
    - surface plots of T, S, MLD, delta q
