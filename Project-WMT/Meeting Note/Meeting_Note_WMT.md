# [[2025-11-13]] Discussion: Paper figures

## Suggestions for the figure modification

### **Figure 1**:
- zoom in to focus on 24-29 kg m-3
- try:
    - separately plot the cluster mean surface-forced AMOC climatology/mean response; Explicitly labeled the $\sigma_{AMOC_{max}}$ in the figure in AMOC panel and WMT distribution panel.
    - Or plot it with the WMT distributions, for which we can have a direct label of $\sigma_{AMOC_{max}}$ in the WMT distribution as well
- Remember the supplementary for all 14 WMT distributions in piControl, Response, (and maybe the 4xCO2)

### **Figure 2**:
- No need to use $\sigma_{max}$. Since it’s only used in the WMT to find the densest portion. Now:
- Simply find the maximum $AMOC_{surf}$ across the entire sigma space
- the WMT should focus on the $\sigma >\sigma_{AMOC_{max}}-0.5$
    - For the choice of $\sigma >\sigma_{AMOC_{max}}-0.5$, search for papers (e.g., Dylan’s paper) for support

### **Figure 3**:
- for the ‘grey’ part, clarifying the LAB and ENA remaining WMT (dark blue and dark orange)
- think of ‘percentage’
    - maybe normalise the WMT by region size? (the motivation: the ENA region is much bigger than the LAB region) → but accounts for the actual contributions to the total WMT, the size also matters, so maybe not

### Figure 4:
- make each scatter plots the same size, organising into a ‘triangular’ shape to highlight the hierarchy of WMT_response vs WMT_climatology
	- WMT_total
		- WMT_lab
			- WMT_lab,T
			- WMT_lab,S
		- WMT_ena
			- WMT_ena,T
			- WMT_ena,S

### Figure 5:
Mechanism plot:
- trace back to the surface density flux formula (see Oldenburg et al. (2021)).
- the surface-forced WMT at each density is calculated by integrating this surface density flux over all surface area in each density bin.
