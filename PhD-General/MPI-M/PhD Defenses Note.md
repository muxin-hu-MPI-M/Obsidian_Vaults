# [[2025-10-28]]Response of the Summer North Atlantic Oscillation to Global Warming

presenter: Quan Liu

- Extremely - NAO (summer NAO extreme) will cause large difference between North and South EU
- GAP: Will GW increase the summer NAO extreme?
    - separate the GW from the internal variability
    - hypothesis: GW will modify the frequency and strength of the summer extreme NAO
    - Change in variability is less examined:
        - analysis on the ensemble spread between the last 10 yrs and first 10 yrs
- Frist Result:
    - Occurrence of summer NAO extremes increases
        - more positive standardised NAO index
        - when remove the shift in means, the distribution of NAO also increases → greater variability under GW warming climate
    - Amplified Impacts on T
        - amplified both warming/cooling effects on EU
    - Emergence in historical period
        - Already evident in the comparison between 1850-1890 to 1980-2015! for both extreme occurrence increase and the variability increase
- Second study: diagnose the physical links
- To the first order, the NAO is impacted by the position of the jet
    - Eddy momentum flux convergence can accelerate the upper-level zonal mean flow → upper level Eddy momentum forcing
    - trasient eddies, which is generated from the low level baroclinicity, excerting a negative eddy feedback → lower level eddy thermal feedback
    - also focused on quasi-geostrophic eddy (from land-ocean contrast)
- Second Result:
    - The change in NAO is a direct effect from the meridional shift in the jet
        - eddy momentum forcing at diff. latitude can largely influence the phase of the NAO. **the momentum forcing is dominated by transient eddies**
        - **quasi-stationary eddies sustain the lower level baroclinicity**
        - **Thus, different types of waves play diff role in summer extreme NAO**
        - **Mechanism**: Enhanced positive eddy thermal feedback from quasi-stationary eddies prolongs to transient eddy generation under GW, increasing summer NA extremes
    - Why the transient eddies generation can be more sustained to generate more summer NAO extremes under GW?
        - GW enhancing land-ocean contrast and also the quasi-stationary eddies
