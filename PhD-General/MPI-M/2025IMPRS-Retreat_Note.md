# Description

Notes for every presentation participated in 2025 MPI IMPRS-ESM retreat during 08.10.2025 → 10.10.2025

# Vidur Mithal

- Large uncertainty in the agricultural productivity changes under climate change

# Climate induced education losses using ISMIP Framwork

#presenter/Aiswarya 

- Heat is bad for learninG:
    - 1 std change in SST lowers the exam scores → ?
    - PISA: Programme for International student assessment, assess how climate change affect human and natural systems withe the help of impact models
- Extreme heat metric: heat days → are more influential under climate change

# Physical Impact of climate change for adaptation strategis

- huge uncertainties in climate models compare to regional model in extreme case:
    - temperature, precipitation
- KM-scale models provide information that bridges global changes to local extremes
    - **KM-scale model**: convection explicitly resolved → better representation of climate extrems. (e.g., ICON, IFS-FESOM)
        - ICON: non-hydrostatic atmosphere, with the biogeochemical processes, FESOM is hydrostatic

# Trees, air pollution and health

How do trees affect air pollution and how does this affect the health outcomes

# How much variability of stratocumulus is determined on large-scales

#presenter/Hairu_Ding: Hairu ding

- stratocumulus and its proxy:
    - proxy: Low cloud cover (LCC); controlled by lower-tropospheric
    - Estimated inversion strength (EIS)
- Unclear about how large-scale circulations controls EIS
    - There’re lagged regression between the RWs (large-scale circulations) and the EIS
    - similar lagged regression to LCC → control by the same synoptic systems under synoptic scale
    - **RW interacts with topography → Phse-lock and amplification of wave → wave-level barotropicity + low-level baroclinicity (instability → EIS)**

# Future extreme precipitation with generative AI

#presenter/Huayu_Chen: Huayu Chen

- both T and P extremes exhibit extreme-get-extermer in a warming climate
- probable maximum precip (PMP)
- Gap 1: Drizzle problem: climate models simulate higer frequency but lower intensity in precip
- Gap 2: complex statistics about the extreme (tail case); precip tail has high sensitivity (regional dependence → **spatial-temporal** dependence)
    - How to capture? Generative AI → capturing the full structure of data distribution
    - Diffusive model

# Fire extreme in Europe from large ensemble

presenter: Victoria

- drivers for wildfire risk that have benn idenified using reanalysis and observations
    - persistent postive anomalies in geopotential height at 500 hpa
    - drought
    - Marine heatwaves
- Large ensembles find FWI extremes to have the duration, intensity, impact, but with low model agreement
- find longer and more widespread events compared to the reanalyses in the current climate
- event with extreme persistent has characteristic:
    - negative relative humidity anomalies
    - mostly positive temperature anomalies
    - mostly negative 6 mon, accumulated precipitation anomalies → low soil moisture
- Potential driver
    - consistent positive anomalies in geopotential height at 500 hpa
    - coherent high SST around the focused region

# Simulating meridional connectivity: dependence on resolution and time scale relative to RAPID and OSNAP

#presenter/Maria_Rapanague: maria Jasus Rapanague

- oversimplified representation of AMOC, complex system in the currents across difference latitudes
- AMOC does not seem to be meridionally connected; but obs are short and all compute the AMOC n difference ways
    - studies show difference results
- Eddy-resolving (ER) models are closer to AMOC observations
    - simulate more realistic current pathways
    - AMOC connectivity on longer time scale
- MPI’s contribution: across al latitude; and interannual to decadal time scales, high resolution
    - in sigma 2 scales, with two high resolution models
    - give phase spectrum (lead-lag)
- **Results**:
    - Interannual timescale:
        - No continuous connectivity to subpolar gyre
        - connectivity to tropical AMO increase with timescales
    - Decadal time scales:
        - connectivity across the whole north alantic
        - show subpolar-subtropical AMOC connection: ~4 years → advection?
        - Fast subtropical-tropical connection: ~ 1 years → waves?
    - OSNAP east dominates the decadal connectivity; OSNAP west becomes important for subpolar AMOC variability on large time scales
    - RAPID ideally located to capture basin-wide AMOC signals

# Hysteresis behavior of the Greenland Ice sheet (GrIS)in a coupled Earth System Model

presenter: Malena

- Potentially irreversible loss of the GrIS due to multistability and hysteresis
- using: MPI-ESM coupled to an ice sheet and land climate model
- Result:
    - slow speed of CO2 increasing: only limited change in GrIS
    - when raise the CO2 level to the level of 2100 expected and continued, reduction in GrIS of 16,000 years
    - no regrowth of GrIS under PI climate conditions
    - The regrow of GrIS strongly delay to the cold climate, but remained quite limited in the size of ice sheets; Large regrowth is only possible in a even colder phase (colder than PI)
        - there are intermediate stages (partia regrowth) causes by climate-ice sheet feedbacks

# Dissipation of Eddy Kinetic Energy (EKE) in ICON-O

#presenter/Dominic_Hillenkötter 

- Eddy moves in the opposite direction to the wind
- 1.5- 2 TW are required to sustain the overutrning circulation
- Disspation
    - vertical dissipation; bottom dissipation; horizontal dissipation
    - rate of geostrophic eddy motion is around 0.77 TW
    - 023 TW is available for deep ocean mixing
    - most dissipation occurs in the mixed layer and removes ageostrphic motion

# TC in ICON: storm-resolving

presenter: Mikael

- stimulating the TCs needs:
    - high hori resolution
    - global domain
    - atmos-ocean coupling
- combining these at decadal time scales is expensive
- Apparent negative biase in TC intensity, but reasonable TC tracks in mostly models
- ICON high resolution has higher intensities in coarser-resolution
- ICON model simulate TCs in the South Atlantic where is the cold area for TCs (no TCs)
- Large-scale climate can partly explain the TC biases
    - Weak vertical wind shear
    - high humidity contribute to high number of TCs in south Atlantic

# CRE- AMOC interaction

#presenter/Jingzhi_Zhang: Jingzhi

- freshwater hosing exp → AMOC reduce → low level clouds increase
- with interactive CRE, AMOC responses less to same hosing strength
    - CRE: Cloud Radiative Effects
- AMOC weakens → SST decrease → stable lower atmosphere → low cloud increases (because on the high latitude, the low level cloud forms more under stable condition) → SST decrease more (reduce the radiative heating in the daytime) → surface density increases (buoyancy loos) → AMOC strengthens
    - CRE → dampen AMOC response? ; Positive correlation (CRE-AMOC)?
- CRE-AMOC correlation is negative with full monthly series; but positive at multi-decadal scales
- interactive cloud experiment has larger and longer AMOC variability
- Result:
    - CRE-AMOC correlation exists in intrinsic climate
    - CRE amplifies but not dampen AMOC variability

# Oceanic teleconnection pathway from

#presenter/Doseok_Lee

- SO delayed in SST warming under CO2 forcing; zonal SST asymmetry in subtropical South Pacific; westerward propagation of equatorial warming
- Is the SO SST pattern only involve atmospheric pathway? comparing simulation with/without ocean
- The change in SST can be decomposed to 3 components: change in radiative flux, change in ocean heat transport and change in turbulent energy

# Cold Tongue heating and self regulation of the Bjerknes Feedback

presenter: Sarsha

- Bjerknes feedback: negative SST anomaly → stronger pressure gradient → stronger winds → stronger upwelling → more negative SST anomaly
- Zebiak & Cane model → little wrong in the assumption → constant La Nina condition under
- **Upwelling doesn’t cool the surface, the entrainment does!!!**
    - Entrainment from the turbulence from various sources
    - Upwelling and entrainment against each other in a way
    - Regarding this, leads to fundamental changes in the system behavior and statistics and thus ENSO prediction (the statistic distribution changes)

# Sea ice advection explains the meltwater iduced SO cooling

presenter: Tomas

- increasing meltwater from Antarctic is projected to enter the SO over the next decade
- Antarctic meltwater induces SO surface cooling that propagates to the rest of the globe
- cooling traditionally explained by reduced vertical heat mixing
- New hypothesis: sea ice advection trigger the cooling
- Decrease in SW radiation dominates the cooling response in SO

# MLD observation in Labrador Sea

presenter: Emilie

- Mixing layer depth (where the turbulence reaches the most?) is shallower than mixed layer depth!!!
- Mixing is confined to the upper mixed layer
- decompose the turbulence to different source by profiles, to tell the relative role in difference forcing by comparing to the mixed layer depth

# Distribution-based upscaling on high resolution INSAR permafrost deformation

#presenter/Zhijun_Liu: Zhijun Liu

- permafrost deformation: vertical change, cause in subsidence
- INSAR data; satellite data
- correlation between climate forcing and INSAR data → need upscaling or downscaling
    - aiming at large-scale climate forcing
    - need the transformation trackable and recover
    - if you downscaling and upscaling, will lose details and ends in wrong focus → save the wrong data characteristics
    - distribution-based upscalling is necessary for high-resolution data upscaling
        - form histogram (distribution) at each grid → have different information (standard deviations, kurtios) → doing correlation with the matrix
    - Consider information in lower moments of data statistics, don’t capture the wrong characters

# How well do large-eddy simulations reproduce an observed maritime cold pool?- results from EUREC4A

#presenter/Nils_Antary: Nils Antary

- **simulated vertical structure of a cold pool:** sub-cloud rain evaporation → evaporative cooling → cold-air downdraft → surface spreading
- cold pool onset is model-dependent

# Building a flexible radiation transfer scheme for climate models

presenter: Ravikiran

- the physics of radiation transfer is well understood
- the problem lies in the radiation transfer scheme that produce the fluxes, heating rate
    - various radiation transfer scheme in either intermediate or high resolution models
    - how much radiation is absorbed in the atmosphere is dependent on the **absorption coefficient** line for each gases across wavelength
- Current scheme: absorption lines (frequency line) → pseudo-monochromatic g-points bands (handful points bands)
    - problem: not physically tractable; limited adaptability; lack of robust uncertainty (different names, very similar implementations across models, undermine uncertainty)
- Building a new radiation transfer scheme:
    - more physical, more adaptable, more flexible, accurate and computational feasible
    - use an optimised set of frequencies in spectral space to calculate the flux instead

# Middle-Atmosphere Clouds

presenter: Vincent

- dissipation rates in the middle atmosphere:
    - indicator of gravity wave breaking and shear instabilities and mirror of climate change effects
    - quantify the transfer of kinetic energy to thermal energy through turbulence
    - crutial in middle atmosphere to close Lorenz cycle

# Attribution of observed Pan-Arctic Extreme fire events to anthropogenic forcing

presenter: Lukas

- observed unprecedented fire activity in the Arctic throughout the 21 century
- estimate arctic fire activity:
    - Burned area (can compare with remote sensing products); fire weather index (FWI); using CESM2 (sufficient spatial and temporal resolution)
- definitions of arctic wildfire events:
    - Magnitude of Arctic Burned area
    - Extreme Arctic Fire Weather potential
- Detection of extreme Arctic Wildfires
    - three satellite products
    - three years, with distinct correlation with the weather pattern, and the hotspots over Siberia and North America
- Attribution of extreme Arctic Wildfire (EAW) events:
    - Attribution metric: risk ratio
    - results: **the risk ratio increases substantially under the anthropogenic forcings** → decompose → physical drivers by removing the effect of one of the four individual contributions
        - decomposition detail: run the simulation with factual T, and compare the one with counter-factual T
        - anthropogenic temperature and humidity changes are the dominate drivers for EAW

# Variability of European Spring warm spells

presenter: Sophie Häfle

- Warm spells: warm T relative to the seasonal norm; characteristic of “off-season”
- A share of warm spells are associated with atmospheric blocking systems
    - persistent, quasi-stationary, high pressure system, interrupt westerlies
    - Detecting **gradient reversal in geopotential hight at 500 hPa**
- In Europe:
    - Northern Europe: summer blocking and extremely hot T co-located
    - about 54% of the spring warm spells co-occurence with blocking
    - but **limited atmospheric conditions beyond classical blocking system**
    - using ERA5 for detecting atmospheric conditions during European spring warm spells
        - using statistics to check the true co-occurence of three: spring warm spells, blocking, high pressure anomaly
        - find difference in the co-occurence in northern/southern European, but both has stronger associations between high pressure anomaly than those with blocking
        - using a deseasonalized and detrended geopotential height at z500, warm spring spells show strong association with high pressure in the same region

# Beyond the medium range: exploring the Machine Learning for climate prediction

presenter: Flix

- the upper ocean is crucial for decadal predictability; but **hard to separate signals from signals of difference source of predictability**
    - Reducing the upper ocean noise in models can improve predictability skills → machine learning can extract the signals automatically
        - **autoregressive modeling setup**, all trained on ERA5, for weather, works well!!
        - autoregressive modeling setup for the upper ocean
            - focus on drivers of decadal variability (e.g., SST)
            - Autoregressive prediction setup
            - Prototype: CUNN architecture (UNet (analog to image analysis, some AI prediction models used this))
                - only see SST anomalies, 100 years of training/validating
                - Learning something: reducing biases

# Explaining neural networks for detection of atmospheric surface fronts in gridded atmospheric data

presenter: Tim

- surface fronts: boundaries between airmasses with different characteristics
- Types of detection of fronts:
    - manual detection: consider multi variable, with expertise, but require manual work: strong changes in T, RH, Wind shear
    - Rule-based detection: automated, cleary defined rules: change sin thermal quantity, place the fronts in warmer side
    - **Neural Network-based detection → Gaps!**
        - Transfer knowledge of experts, automated
        - fast
        - but black box!
- **Layerwise relevance propagation**: originally for explain image classification
    - ANN looks at frontal zone close to front;
    - but spurious correlations with the background data (noise, negative points)
    - how to improve: create composites over the whole dataset!
        - detect fronts → calculate normals along fronts → straighten fronts to get composite

# Understanding variability and uncertainties in observed freshwater transports in the South Atlantic
