        "text": " On the other hand, the total energy (i. e. its rate of decrease if there is no energy input, or its forcing if there is) and thus the properties of the large eddies are directly related to the dissipation.** Therefore, one can assume that the dissipation is determined by the energy and scale of the large eddies → $\\epsilon=f(\\varepsilon,L)$. A simple dimensional argument shows that the only possible combination between $E$ and $L$ to form the dimension of $\\epsilon$ is given by:\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\epsilon=c_{\\epsilon}\\frac{\\varepsilon^{3/2}}{L} \\tag{23}\\end{equation} $$\n\nWhere the $c_{\\epsilon}$ denotes a dimensionless constant which is experimentally found. The timescale for the decrease of kinetic energy is: \n$$ \\begin{equation} T_{0}=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{\\frac{d\\varepsilon}{dt}}=\\frac{\\varepsilon}{c_{\\epsilon}\\varepsilon^{3/2}/L}=\\frac{1}{c_{\\epsilon}}\\frac{L}{\\varepsilon^{1/2}}=\\frac{1}{c_{\\epsilon}}\\frac{L}{U} \\tag{24}\\end{equation} $$\nwhere the $L/U=T_{adv}$ denotes an advective time-scale of the large eddies. Therefore, the energy content is changing on the time-scale $T_{adv}$. As a consequence, there must be energy input on the scale $L$ to sustain the turbulent flow.\n\n### Micro Scale\nFor small $r$, the longitudinal correlation $f(r)$ can be expanded in a Taylor series, one can get:\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\lambda^{2}=-\\frac{1}{f''(0)} \\tag{25}\\end{equation} $$\nThe length scale $\\lambda$ reflects the curvature of $f(r)$ at $r=0$ and is referred to as TAYLOR’s micro scale, which can also be expressed in terms of energy spectrum:\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\frac{1}{\\lambda^{2}}=\\frac{1}{5}\\frac{\\int k^{2}E(k)dk}{\\int E(k)dk} \\tag{26}\\end{equation} $$\nReplacing integral with $\\varepsilon$ and $\\epsilon$ in Eq.

But it turns that this micro scale at which viscous forcing dominates inertial forces, it is still much larger.\n\n### Relation between Integral Length Scale and Micro Scale\nIn Eq. (23) and Eq. (27) they both have the expression of the dissipation $\\epsilon$. Thus two equations can be connected, yielding:\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\frac{L^{2}}{\\lambda^{2}}=c_{\\epsilon}\\frac{\\varepsilon^{1/2}L}{10\\kappa_{m}}=c_{\\epsilon}\\frac{Re_{L}}{10} \\tag{28}\\end{equation} $$\nwhere the Reynolds number of large eddies are introduced:\n$$ Re_{L}=\\frac{UL}{\\kappa_{m}}=\\frac{\\varepsilon^{1/2}}{\\kappa_{m}} $$\nHence:\n- Turbulent flow: $Re_{L}>> 1$, we have $L>>\\lambda$\n- For an energy spectrum with strong exponential decay for $k>1/L$, the length scales $L,\\lambda$ have the same order of magnitude.\n\n\n## 11.1.4 Equilibrium Range and Inertial Subrange\n\nIn smaller scales, there is no need to have energy input to sustain the turbulence, hence the Energy balance equation in Eq. (16) can reduce to:\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\frac{\\partial F(k)}{\\partial k}=-2\\kappa_{m}k^{2}E(k) \\quad \\text{or}\\quad F(k)=2\\kappa_{m}\\int_{k}^{\\infty}k'^{2}E(k')dk' \\tag{29}\\end{equation} $$\nor any wave number k in the equilibrium range.\n\nHere $F(k)>0$, i.e., **energy, is indeed transported through the spectrum toward higher wave numbers and is finally dissipated at small scales**.\n\nWe further assume that the energy is transported between wave numbers which are close together (turbulent cascade), so that in the equilibrium range the details of the flow at the large scale $L$ are irrelevant. It is then clear that the spectrum $E(k)$ must depend on $k$, $\\kappa_{m}$ and $\\epsilon$ in the equilibrium range. In the absence of other, e. g. geometric, constraints, that dependence must be universal, i.e., $E=\\Phi(k, \\epsilon, \\kappa_{m})$.\n\n> [!Attention]\n> 🔥 These variables in this universal relation have the dimensions:\n> - - Turbulent energy spectrum at per unit mass $E=m^{2}s^{-2}$;\n> - - Turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass $\\varepsilon \\sim \\frac{1}{2}U^{2}\\sim m^{2}s^{-2}$\n> - - Wave number $k=m^{-1}$;\n> - - Kinematic viscosity of seawater **($\\kappa_{m}=\\nu/\\rho$):** $\\kappa_{m}=m^{2}s^{-1}$\n> - - Energy dissipation rate at per unit mass: $\\epsilon =m^{2}s^{-3}$\n\nWith the dimensional analysis, we can introduce:\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\lambda_{d}=(\\kappa_{m}^{3}/\\epsilon)^{1/4} \\tag{30}\\end{equation} $$\n\nWhich is given by dissipation and viscosity and **is called the dissipation length scale or Kolmogorov’s microscale.**\n\nOne can show that the dissipation spectrum $k^{2}E(k)$ in Eq. (29) has a maximum near the wave number $1/\\lambda_{d}$. Defining the velocity scale in the dissipation range as:\n$$ \\begin{equation} U_{d}=(\\epsilon\\kappa_{m})^{1/4} \\tag{31}\\end{equation} $$\n\nwhich is the only combination with the correct dimension.\n\nThe dissipation time scale for this dissipation velocity scale is:\n$$ \\begin{equation} T_{d}=(\\frac{\\kappa_{m}}{\\epsilon})^{1/4} \\tag{32}\\end{equation} $$\n\nThe Reynolds number at the dissipation length scale $\\lambda_{d}$ follows as $Re_{d}=U_{d}\\lambda_{d}/\\kappa_{m}=1$. **Hence, at the scale $\\lambda_{d}$ inertial forces no longer dominate, and the turbulent transfer of energy ends here.**\n\nHence, the three length scale are well separated in the normal case where the Reynolds number is large ($Re \\gg1$). **The micro scale $\\lambda$ is much smaller than the integral scale $L$, but also much larger than the dissipation scale $\\lambda_{d}$ at which the viscous and inertial forces become comparable**\n\n### Inertial Subrange\n**For wave numbers in the range $1/L \\ll k\\ll 1/\\lambda_{d}$,** dissipation must be small, only the inertial forces are important for the flow in the inertial subrange. According to Eq. (29), the energy flux is constant and equals the dissipation $\\epsilon$. Therefore, one can assume that the characteristic features of the turbulence depend only on $\\epsilon$ but not on the viscosity $\\kappa_{m}$. For energy spectrum, this means that $\\phi(k\\lambda_{d})=const=c_{k}$, hence:\n$$ \\begin{equation} E(k)=c_{k}\\epsilon^{2/3}k^{-5/3} \\tag{33}\\end{equation} $$\n![[Screenshot 2025-10-20 at 10.29.31.png | center]]^Conceptual sketch of the turbulent energy spectrum in the inertial subrange (logarithmic scaling), which extents from the integral length scale of the largest eddies to the dissipation length scale.\n\nPrerequisite for the existence of an inertial subrange is:\n- **a very large Reynolds number** on the large scale $L$, an assumption which often holds in the ocean and the atmosphere.\n- This spectral law holds only for **small-scale three-dimensional and isotropic turbulence**, an important restriction\n\n\n## **Summary of Kolmogorov’s theory of turbulence:**\n\n>[!Attention]\n>**Length scale and equilibrium range**\n>Kolmogorov viewed turbulence as a **cascade of energy**: large eddies break down into smaller and smaller eddies, transferring kinetic energy through a hierarchy of scales until it finally dissipates by viscosity.\n>So there are **three main length scales** in this cascade:\n\n| Name                                                     | Physical meaning                                                                                                     | Dominant forces                                                                                 | Reynolds number |\n| -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |\n| **Integral scale**                                       | size of the largest eddies; where energy is injected into the flow (e.g. from wind shear or convection)              | **Inertial forces dominate**, energy is injected into turbulence (sustained by external energy) | $Re\\gg1$        |\n| **Inertial range scales**                                | Intermediate scales between integral scale and dissipation scale.

While if $w'<0$, then $u'>0$, illustrated in the figure below\n\nIn both cases, it is clear that $\\overline{u'w'}<0$. Expanding the $\\overline{u}(z_{0}+l')$ in a Taylor series (when the vertical deviation $l'$ is small), which leads to:\n$$ \\overline{u}(z_{0}+l')=\\overline{u}(z_{0})+l'\\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z}\\bigg|_{z_{0}}+\\frac{1}{2}(l'^{2})\\frac{\\partial^{2} \\overline{u}}{\\partial^{2} z}\\bigg|_{z_{0}} +... $$\nThen we’ll have the expression of $u'$, and **ignore the higher order terms** (**because $l'$ is much smaller compared to the scales of the mean flow**)\n$$ \\begin{equation} u'=-\\overline{u}(z_{0}+l')+\\overline{u}(z_{0})\\approx-l'\\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z}\\bigg|_{z_{0}} \\tag{41}\\end{equation} $$\n\nIt follows that\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\overline{u'w'}=-\\overline{w'l'}\\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z} =-K_{u}\\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z} \\tag{42}\\end{equation} $$\nOne can expect $w'$ and $l'$ to be positively correlated → $\\overline{w'l'}>0$\n\nAssuming isotropy so that $\\overline{w'^{2}}\\approx\\overline{u'^{2}}$, this result is equivalent to:\n$$ \\overline{w'l'}=c(\\overline{w'^2}\\:\\overline{l'^2})^{1/2}=c(\\overline{u'^2}\\:\\overline{l'^2})^{1/2}=c(\\overline{l'^2}(\\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z})^{2}\\:\\overline{l'^2})^{1/2} $$\n\n> [!Attention]\n> Thus, the turbulent diffusivity:\n> \n> $$ \\begin{equation} K_{u}=cl^{2} \\bigg|\\frac{\\partial \\overline{u}}{\\partial z}\\bigg| \\tag{43}\\end{equation} $$\n> \n> where the **length scale $l=(\\overline{l'^2})^{1/2}$ is the** _**time-mean mixing-length**_.

(39)) can also be modified for situations where the large eddies are explicitly resolved, and turbulent diffusion is caused by velocity fluctuations on smaller scales.\n\nSpecifically, assume that only wave numbers $k\\ge k_{*}$ in the inertial subrange contribute to velocity. The energy $\\varepsilon_{*}$ of these fluctuations is:\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\varepsilon_{*}=\\int_{k_{*}}^{k_{d}}c_{k}\\epsilon^{2/3}k^{-5/3}dk\\approx \\int_{k_{*}}^{\\infty}c_{k}\\epsilon^{2/3}k^{-5/3}dk=\\frac{3c_{k}}{5}\\epsilon^{2/3}k_{*}^{-2/3} \\tag{45}\\end{equation} $$\nAssume that the diffusivity $K_{s}$ associated with these fluctuations is given as $K_{s}=\\varepsilon_{*}^{1/2}l_{*}$according to Eq. (39), with $l_{*}=1/k_{*}$. One obtains (up to the first order):\n$$ \\begin{equation} K_{s}\\approx\\epsilon^{1/3}l_{*}^{4/3}=\\varepsilon^{1/2}L(l_{*}/L)^{4/3} \\tag{46}\\end{equation} $$\nwhere the relation in [Eq. (23)](https://www.notion.so/Ocean-Dynamic-Chapter-11-Small-Scale-Turbulence-28e69691c52b800780bff3677d418d3b?pvs=21) has been used for the last equality.\n\n> [!Attention]\n> In numerical circulation models, Eq. (46) is occasionally used to parameterise *subgrid* scale motions. It is possible to relate the scale $l_{*}$ with the resolution, i.e., $l_{*}\\approx\\Delta x$, which is particularly useful when the resolution is variable.\n\n\n## 11.2.2 Turbulent Diffusion in the Lagrangian Reference System\n\nIn Lagrangian coordinates, it is possible to relate the mean rate of spreading with statistical properties of the flow field. The following description was given by Taylor.\nA particle is advected by a **turbulent flow $u(x,t)$ (assumed to be 1D and stationary for simplicity), with $\\overline{u}(x,t)=0$. Which means $u(x,t)=u'(x,t)$**\nThe particle starts from the location $x_{0}$ at time $t_{0}$, and is at the time $t$ at the location $x(t)$.\nIn the Lagrangian system one has:\n$$ \\frac{dx(t)}{dt}=v(t)\\quad or \\quad x(t)=\\int_{0}^{t}v(t')dt'\n$$\nwhere the $v(t)=u(x(t),t)$ denotes the Lagrangian velocity at position $x(t)$ and time $t$.\n**Since $\\overline{v}=\\overline{u}=0$, $v=v'$ and it follows that $\\overline{x}=0$ → on time average, the particle does not move away from its origin.**\n\nThe mean quadratic excursion of the particle $\\overline{x^{2}}$ (**how far particles have spread due to e.g., turbulent**)is given by:\n$$ \\frac{d\\overline{x^{2}}}{dt}=\\overline{2x(t)\\frac{dx(t)}{dt}}=\\overline{2v(t)\\int_{0}^{t}v(t')dt'}=2\\int_{0}^{t}\\overline{v(t)v(t')}dt' $$\nand thus leads to Taylor’s diffusion equation\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\frac{d\\overline{x^{2}}}{dt}=2\\int_{0}^{t}R^{L}(\\tau)d\\tau \\tag{47}\\end{equation} $$\nHere the $R^{L}(\\tau)=R^{L}(t-t')$ denotes the ",

In the following sections, energetic constraints for inhomogeneous turbulence are derived, and applications to the dynamics of the ocean mixed layer are discussed\n\nStarting point are the equations of motion in the Boussinesq approximation in Eq.

The deep buoyancy $b_*$ has to be specified.\n- The parameter $\\Delta=h_* -h$ characterises the pycnocline thickness and is assumed to be constant and small $\\Delta \\ll h$So that effectively the pycnocline is modelled as a discontinuity at the mixed layer base\n![[Screenshot 2025-10-22 at 13.51.35 1.png | center]]*Sketch of profiles of buoyancy (blue line) and vertical (radiative + turbulent) buoyancy flux (red line) in bulk mixed layer models.*\n\nThe physics of the mixed layer model should determine both $b_0(t)$ and $h(t)$ from the specified surface buoyancy flux and the characteristics of the turbulence in that layer.\n**It is useful to define $Q=-\\overline{(J_3^b+b'w')}$ as the vertical (*radiative (from Eq. 59)* + turbulent) buoyancy flux** (positive downwards into the ocean). As evident from (64), for $b$ to be constant in the mixed layer, $Q(z)$ must be a linear function of depth:\n$$ \\begin{equation} Q(z)=Q_0+\\frac{z}{h}(Q_0-Q_h) \\tag{66}\\end{equation} $$\nHere:\n\n- $Q_0$ is the net surface buoyancy flux which is considered as a **prescribed** forcing\n- $Q_h$ is the $Q(z=-h)$ the **flux at the mixed layer base**. The radiative component of the $Q_h$ can normally be neglected, except in certain situations with very shallow mixed layers\n\nIntegration of (64) from $z=-h$ to $z=0$ and from $z=-h_*$ to $z=-h$, respectively leads to:\n$$ \\begin{equation} h\\frac{\\partial b_0}{\\partial t}=Q_0-Q_h \\quad and\\quad (b_0-b_*)\\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t}=Q_h-Q_* \\tag{67}\\end{equation} $$\n\nUsually, $Q_*=Q(z=-h_*)$ is small and neglected though it could easily be retained e.g., as a diffusive flux below the mixed layer.\n\nSince $b_0-b_*>0$ in a stable stratification, the mixed layer will deepen if the buoyancy flux $Q_h$ is positive (i.e., downward). In this case, fluid of buoyancy $b_*$ from below the mixed layer is mixed (or ‘entrained’) into the mixed layer and brought to $b_0$. **This mixing consumes turbulent energy** and hence can only take place if sufficient TKE is available for mixing fluid from below into the mixed layer\n\n> [!Tip]\n> The **basic assumption of mixed layer physics is that $Q_h$ originates from turbulent processes within the mixed layer** and, therefore, cannot become negative since there is no ‘un-mixing’ of fluid from the mixed layer. Instead, when $Q_h$ drops to zero, there is insufficient turbulent energy to continue mixing at the mixed layer base. Mixing and deepening of the mixed layer then stops, and **new mixed layer is established at a shallower depth**\n\nThus the mixed layer depth is determined from the budget of TKE, which usually equilibrates within a few minutes.\n\nIgnoring the shear production term (for simplicity) in (65), integration from $-h$ to 0 with (66) then yields\n$$ \\begin{equation} 0=F_0-F_h-\\frac{h}{2}(Q_0+Q_h)-\\int_{-h}^{0}\\epsilon dz \\tag{68}\\end{equation} $$\n**A few further assumptions (parameterisations) close the problem.**\n- The turbulent energy input $F_0$ is related to the wind stress $\\tau_0$ (by exciting surface waves, which by breaking create TKE). From dimensional arguments, one assumes $F_0=c|\\tau_0|^{3/2}$ with a dimensionless coefficient $c=O(1)$, while $F_h$ is assumed small and neglected.\n- To close the positive dissipation term, simply assume that a fraction $r_1$ of the (positive) wind input $F_0$ is dissipated.\n- In situations when buoyancy is lost at the surface, i. e. when $Q_0<0$, which occurs mainly by cooling, the potential energy of the heavier fluid is converted to TKE, and it is likewise assumed that a fraction $r_2$ of this TKE gain is dissipated. Hence the dissipation term is expressed as\n    $$ \\int_{-h}^{0}\\epsilon dz=r_1F_0+r_2\\frac{h}{4}(|Q_0|-Q_0) $$\n    with $0<r_1,r_2<1$.\n\nThis relation, together with (68), finally leads to the required parameterisation of $Q_h$in the form\n$$ \\begin{equation} \\frac{h}{2}Q_h=(1-r_1)c|\\tau_0|^{3/2}-\\frac{h}{2}\\bigg[(1-\\frac{r_1}{r_2})Q_0+\\frac{r_2}{2}|Q_0|\\bigg] \\tag{69}\\end{equation} $$\n\nWith **specified (prescribed)** forcing terms $\\tau_0$ and $Q_0$, the recipe to calculate the mixed layer depth $h(t)$ is now as follows:\n- If $Q_h>0$ in (69), it is used to compute $h(t)$ from the _**prognostic**_ equation (67) → deepening of mix layer as downward buoyancy flux\n- If $Q_h\\le0$ in (69), which can only happen when $Q_0>0$, $h$ is determined from the _**diagnostic**_ equation (69) as balance between mechanical forcing and buoyancy gain by setting $Q_h=0$ (see below) → insufficient turbulence energy, determine mixed layer depth by prescribed net surface buoyancy flux\n$$ \\begin{equation} h=1(1-r_1)c|\\tau_0|^{3/2}/Q_0 \\tag{70}\\end{equation} $$\n\nThe algorithm reflects the fundamental difference between the processes of deepening and shallowing of the mixed layer.
