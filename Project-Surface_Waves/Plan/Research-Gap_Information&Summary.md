# Research Gap

## Main Gap
**“Poorly quantifying surface wave effects and their relative importance in the modification of air-sea interactions in Southeast Pacific Upwelling system”**

### Sub Gaps:
- What’s the relative contribution from local wind pattern (local wave), comparing to the contributions from Swells (remote wave)
	- Southern Ocean, characterised by strong winds and significant wave-climate, will be the major source of remote waves
- Which wave-effect dominate the air-sea interactions? What’s its role in upwelling system?
- Are there any wave-upwelling feedback mechanisms in such fully coupled simulation?

### Considered Wave Effects
- momentum flux (wind/wave stress)
- Stokes drift related effects (e.g., Langmuir Turbulence, Stokes-Coriolis force, advection by Stokes drift)
- surface roughness
- might change heat fluxes, momentum flux, in the atmosphere

## Background
### Why Southeast Pacific?
- The **Southeast Pacific** presents a compelling region for investigating the effects of surface waves on air-sea interactions due to its complex and dynamically changing wave climate.
	- The **equatorial tropical regions** are characterised by a **complex multimodal wave climate**, driven by the interaction of **remotely generated swells**—primarily the dominant **Southern Ocean generated swell**—and **higher-frequency waves generated by prevailing trade winds**. This complexity results in a high annual mean wave period that exceeds 10 s in this area.
	- Historically, the broader **South Pacific** region has shown evidence of **significant positive trends** in high-frequency significant wave height ($H_s$) extremes (90th percentile), with increases ranging from **$0.5$ to $1 \text{ cm } \text{yr}^{-1}$**.
	- Furthermore, this region is projected to experience one of the most significant climate changes in its wave field, with the **mean wave height** ($H_s$) projected to **rise by 5–10% by 2100**. This makes the Southeast Pacific a critical and sensitive area to quantify the present and future relative importance of surface wave effects in the modification of local air-sea heat, momentum, and gas fluxes.

### Why upwelling systems?
- The Foundation: Upwelling is largely Driven by Wind Stress.
	- Since the rate and intensity of upwelling are directly proportional to the magnitude of the initial **wind stress ($\tau$)} and the subsequent **Ekman currents**, any process that modifies either of these is critical to model accurately.
	- Surface waves modify momentum/tracer fluxes in the air-sea interface. Its corresponding wave effect is therefore has large potential to influence the simulation of upwelling systems
		- “In addition, waves can significantly affect momentum flux in the coastal areas affected by coastal upwelling” (Wu et al., 2022, p. 1492)
	- The Flaw in traditional models
		- the impact of surface waves on air-sea interaction processes is often ignored
		- limited coupling between atmosphere, and ocean oversimplify the important role of surface waves, which act as intermediate reservoir for momentum and energy

### General Role of Surface Waves in Air-sea Interaction (Wu et al., 2022)
- **Momentum Flux Buffering:** Waves significantly alter the wind stress, which is the momentum flux, across the interface2222. Waves act as a **buffering role** in the transfer of energy and momentum and **redistribute** these fluxes both in time and space3.
- **Decoupling of Stress:** The presence of waves means the **ocean-side stress** ($\tau_{oc}$), which drives ocean circulation and dynamics, is often **not identical** to the **air-side stress** ($\tau_{a}$), which is the momentum flux lost from the atmosphere44. Waves can alter both the **magnitude and direction** of the stress transferred to the ocean555.
- **TKE Generation:** **Wave breaking** is the primary mechanism that enhances the **Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) dissipation rate** in the near-surface layer6. The resulting breaking-induced TKE flux can significantly affect key ocean variables, including **sea surface temperature (SST)** and **surface currents**.

#### Relevance to the Southeast Pacific Upwelling System
- **Coastal Dynamics:** The redistributive role of waves in stress becomes **more significant closer to coasts** due to strong wind gradients13131313.
- **Upwelling Sensitivity:** Coastal **upwelling** is determined by the **ocean-side stress ($\tau_{oc}$), not the air-side stress ($\tau_{a}$)**14. Therefore, waves can **significantly alter** the momentum flux and, consequently, **coastal upwelling**15.
- **Need for Further Study:** The redistributive role of the sea state on **coastal upwelling** and climate simulations **needs to be investigated further**16.

### Traditional Model Limitations (Wu et al., 2019)
- **Traditional atmosphere, ocean, wave models run independently**
	- the impact of surface waves on air-sea interaction processes is often ignored since the temporal and spatial scales of surface waves are much smaller than the atmospheric and oceanic dynamic scales (Hasselmann, 1991)
	- Energy and momentum fluxes do not fully account for the impact of the oceanic wave field at the air-sea interface
- **Invalid Core Assumption:** In traditional atmosphere, ocean, and coupled models, the momentum flux to the ocean interior ($\tau_{oc}$) is commonly **assumed to be identical** to the momentum flux lost from the atmosphere ($\tau_{a}$). This assumption is **invalid** under non-equilibrium conditions, such as **growing and decaying waves** and in **fetch-limited conditions**.
- **Neglected Wave Dynamics:** The wave-induced alteration of stress magnitude and, particularly, the **directional difference** between $\tau_{oc}$ and $\tau_{a}$ are **rarely considered** in coupled climate and forecast models.
- **Poorly Quantified TKE:** TKE flux is often parameterised as a function of surface friction velocity when a wave model is unavailable. This traditional parameterisation is generally **not adequate** under the non-equilibrium sea states (growing and decaying waves) that are common over the open ocean12.
- **Inclusion of wave effects have been proved to improves the model performance** compare to the stand alone circulation model
	- (Wu et al., 2019) concludes that the inclusion of waves improves the model performance in terms of sea level height, temperature and circulation
	- But in Wu et al., 2019, the ocean model is forced by wave model. there’s no coupling between atmosphere, wave and ocean, no feedback from the wave field to the atmosphere, no feedback from the ocean interior to the wave field

### Both Wu’s studies ignore the Langmuir turbulence and bottom stress terms
- The Stokes production of TKE occurs when the **turbulent Reynolds stresses** in the oceanic mixed layer interact with the **vertical shear of the Stokes drift velocity** (the wave-induced Lagrangian current). This interaction extracts energy directly from the surface waves and injects it into the turbulence of the upper ocean
- Studies have demonstrated that the magnitude of Stokes production of TKE can be **of the same order as the conventional shear production** (i.e., TKE generated by the shear of the mean Eulerian current).

### Why studies different impact from waves?
- There’re complex interactions between these wave effects.
	- For example, (Wu et al., 2019) founded that the stokes drift advection could largely counters the effect of the Coriolis-Stokes Force on ocean circulation. But two effects do not always cancel entirely, as seen for the SST and associated coastal upwelling in Baltic Sea.
- Thus, consistently introduce these wave effects together and investigate their relative contributions is important.

### The use of ICON-wave
- The **ICON-Wave** is a fully coupled wave model with the new energetically consistent coupling wave approach that can be applied in both intermediate (e.g., CMIP-type models) and high-resolution (5 km ocean, 5km or 10 km atmosphere coupled) configuration.
- It provides the opportunity to investiagte the wave-effects in an atmosphere-ocean-wave energetically consistent fully coupling.


## What’s New in our (target) Study compare to literature in the field
- We aim to conduct a full atmosphere-wave-ocean coupling simulation with the new energetically consistent coupling approach.
	- the ICON model is capable to investigate the wave effects and their feedback to the atmosphere/ocean field.
	- provide a full picture of the wave influence in air-sea interactions in key climate systems, like the upwelling
- With the ICON, different wave-effects can be studied, including: (1) momentum flux (wind/wave stress); (2) Stokes drift related effects (e.g., Langmuir Turbulence, Stokes-Coriolis force, advection by Stokes drift); (3) surface roughness.
	- Their relative role in air-sea interactions over the upwelling system can be specified
	- The dominant role can be identified
	- Some previously ignored wave effects in climate models(namely, the Langmuir Turbulence, an important source for TKE production), can be quantified and studied.


# Summary in Paragraph
This version is also the draft for my first Panel Report

Surface waves play a fundamental role in mediating air-sea exchanges of momentum, heat, and turbulent energy, and their influence is expected to be particularly important in wind-driven coastal upwelling systems (Wu et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2022). Coastal upwelling results from wind-driven horizontal divergence that causes cold, nutrient-rich subsurface water to rise to the surface. Its intensity and structure are therefore primarily controlled by the along-shore wind stress and the associated offshore Ekman transport that induces this divergence (Belmadani et al., 2014; Tarazona & Arntz, 2001). Any process modifying the magnitude or direction of stress at the air-sea interface thus has the potential to substantially affect costal upwelling dynamics. Surface waves may contribute to this modulation through multiple wave-induced processes, including wave-modified momentum fluxes, Stokes-drift-related processes, wave-induced turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) fluxes, and changes in surface roughness. 

Previous studies have demonstrated that surface waves can significantly influence air-sea interactions in coastal regions and associated upwelling systems. For example, based on a wave hindcast generated with WAVEWATCH III forced by Climate Forecast System Reanalysis data, Wu et al. (2022) found that the redistributive effects of waves on momentum and TKE fluxes are significant in several major coastal upwelling regions worldwide. Similarly, using a regional configuration of Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) model forced by the WAve Model (WAM), Wu et al. (2019) showed that the wave-induced momentum and TKE fluxes exert a stronger influence on Baltic coastal upwelling than that from Stokes-Coriolis forcing and Stokes drift on the mass and tracer advection. These results thus indicate that various wave-induced processes can play distinct roles in shaping air-sea fluxes and upwelling dynamics, leading to complex combined effect.

However, the interpretation of these results is constrained by methodological limitations. In particular, most existing studies employ uncoupled or one-way coupled modelling frameworks, which prevent feedbacks between the atmosphere, wave field, and ocean interior. As a result, the simulated wave-filed is not evolving interactively with the atmospheric and ocean states, thereby limiting the dynamical consistency of the simulated coastal air-sea exchanged. In addition, not all relevant wave-induced processes are represented consistently across studies. For example, Langmuir turbulence, an important contributor to the upper-ocean TKE production (Kantha et al., 2009, 2010) is not always included or is treated in a simplified manner. Consequently, while previous work provides valuable insights into individual wave effects within specific model configurations, it does not yet offer a dynamically consistent assessment of these wave-induced processes and their combined influence of surface waves on coastal upwelling systems.

To address the limitations identified above, we aim to investigate wave effects on air–sea interactions in upwelling system using a fully coupled ocean–wave–atmosphere modelling framework. Specifically, we aim to employ the ICON model, in which ICON-a (atmosphere), ICON-Wave (Wave), and ICON-o (Ocean) are coupled using a new energetically consistent exchange of momentum and energy. This framework allows surface waves, atmospheric forcing, and oceanic responses to evolve interactively, while enabling a more realistic representation of key wave-induced processes, including the Langmuir turbulence. The Southeast Pacific (Peru–Chile) upwelling system is chosen as the focus of this study. This region is characterised by persistent alongshore winds and a complex, multimodal wave climate arising from the coexistence of locally generated wind waves and remotely generated Southern Ocean swell. Observational and hindcast studies indicate pronounced wave variability in this region, including increasing trends in high-frequency significant wave height extremes, while future projections suggest further changes in the regional wave climate (Casas-Prat et al., 2024). These features make the Southeast Pacific a sensitive and climatically relevant testbed for the fundamental study on how surface waves modulate air–sea fluxes and influence coastal upwelling dynamics.

Specifically, this PhD seeks to address the following research questions:
1. Which wave-induced processes, namely wave-modified momentum fluxes, Stokes-drift-related effects (i.e., Langmuir turbulence, the Coriolis–Stokes force, and Stokes drift on mass and tracer advection), and wave-induced changes in surface roughness, play the dominate role in the modulation of air-sea exchanges in coastal upwelling region in Southeast Pacific?
2. How do these wave-induced modifications influence the intensity, vertical structure, and temporal variability of Southeast Pacific coastal upwelling?
3. What are the relative contributions of locally generated wind waves and remotely generated swells to air–sea exchanges in the Southeast Pacific upwelling system?

By systematically incorporating and evaluating multiple wave-induced processes within a fully coupled and energetically consistent modelling framework, this research seeks to provide a process-based and quantitative assessment of surface-wave impacts on air-sea interactions in one of the key upwelling systems. The results are expected to improve understanding of the mechanisms linking surface wave, air-sea interactions, and upwelling dynamics, and to help clarify the relative importance of different wave-induced processes in such systems.
