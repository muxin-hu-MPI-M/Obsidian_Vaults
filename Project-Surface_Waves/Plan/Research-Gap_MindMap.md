# Research Gap
## Main Gap
**“Poorly quantified surface wave effects and their relative importance in the modification of air-sea interactions in Southeast Pacific Upwelling System”**
### Sub Gaps:
- What’s the relative contribution from local wind pattern (local wave), comparing to the contributions from Swells (remote wave)
	- SO will be the major source
- Limited understanding in the coupling mechanisms of surface wave and upwelling system

 
### Considered Wave Effects
Wave effects we anticipate to investigate
- momentum flux (wind/wave stress)
- Stokes drift related effects (e.g., Langmuir Turbulence, Stokes-Coriolis force, advection by Stokes drift)
- surface roughness 
	- might change heat fluxes, momentum flux, in the atmophere 

## Background
“The surface wave influence on the upwelling has rarely been investigated in previous studies.” (Wu et al., 2019, p. 9) 
### Limited fully coupling approach in wind-wave studies (Wu et al., 2019)
- **Traditional atmosphere, ocean, wave models run independently**
	- the impact of surface waves on air-sea interaction processes is often ignored since the temporal and spatial scales of surface waves are much smaller than the atmospheric and oceanic dynamic scales (Hasselmann, 1991)
	- Energy and momentum fluxes do not fully account for the impact of the oceanic wave field at the air-sea interface
- **Inclusion of wave effects have been proved to improves the model performance** compare to the stand alone circulation model
	- (Wu et al., 2019) concludes that the inclusion of waves improves the model performance in terms of sea level height, temperature and circulation
- However, these studies coupled wave to ocean OR atmosphere circulation model only, not the fully atmosphere-ocean-wave coupling

### Why upwelling systems?
- The Foundation: Upwelling is largely Driven by Wind Stress.
	- Since the rate and intensity of upwelling are directly proportional to the magnitude of the initial **wind stress ($\tau$)} and the subsequent **Ekman currents**, any process that modifies either of these is critical to model accurately.
	- Surface waves modify momentum/tracer fluxes in the air-sea interface. Its corresponding wave effect is therefore has large potential to influence the simulation of upwelling systems
- The Flaw in traditional models
	- the impact of surface waves on air-sea interaction processes is often ignored
	- limited coupling between atmosphere, and ocean oversimplify the important role of surface waves, which act as intermediate reservoir for momentum and energy
### Why studies different impact from waves?
- There’re complex interactions between these wave effects. 
	- For example, (Wu et al., 2019) founded that the stokes drift advection could largely counters the effect of the Coriolis-Stokes Force on ocean circulation. But two effects do not always cancel entirely, as seen for the SST and associated coastal upwelling in Baltic Sea.
- Thus, consistently introduce these wave effects together and investigate their relative contributions is important. 
### Why Southeast Pacific? 
- The **Southeast Pacific** presents a compelling region for investigating the effects of surface waves on air-sea interactions due to its complex and dynamically changing wave climate. 
- The **equatorial tropical regions** are characterised by a **complex multimodal wave climate**, driven by the interaction of **remotely generated swells**—primarily the dominant **Southern Ocean generated swell**—and **higher-frequency waves generated by prevailing trade winds**. This complexity results in a high annual mean wave period that exceeds 10 s in this area. 
- Historically, the broader **South Pacific** region has shown evidence of **significant positive trends** in high-frequency significant wave height ($H_s$) extremes (90th percentile), with increases ranging from **$0.5$ to $1 \text{ cm } \text{yr}^{-1}$**.
- Furthermore, this region is projected to experience one of the most significant climate changes in its wave field, with the **mean wave height** ($H_s$) projected to **rise by 5–10% by 2100**. This makes the Southeast Pacific a critical and sensitive area to quantify the present and future relative importance of surface wave effects in the modification of local air-sea heat, momentum, and gas fluxes.

### The use of ICON-wave
- The **ICON-Wave** is a fully coupled wave model with the new energetically consistent coupling wave approach that can be applied in both intermediate (e.g., CMIP-type models) and high-resolution (5 km ocean, 5km or 10 km atmosphere coupled) configuration.
- It provides the opportunity to investiagte the wave-effects in an atmosphere-ocean-wave energetically consistent fully coupling.
