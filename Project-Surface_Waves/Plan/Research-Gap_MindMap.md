# Research Gap
## Main Gap
**“Poorly quantified surface wave effects and their relative importance in the modification of air-sea interactions in Southeast Pacific Upwelling System”**
### Sub Gaps:
- What’s the relative contribution from local wind pattern (local wave), comparing to the contributions from Swells (remote wave)
	- SO will be the major source
- Limited understanding in the coupling mechanisms of surface wave and upwelling system

 
### Considered Wave Effects
Wave effects we anticipate to investigate
- momentum flux (wind/wave stress)
- Stokes drift related effects (e.g., Langmuir Turbulence, Stokes-Coriolis force, advection by Stokes drift)
- surface roughness 
	- might change heat fluxes, momentum flux, in the atmophere 

## Background
“The surface wave influence on the upwelling has rarely been investigated in previous studies.” (Wu et al., 2019, p. 9) 
### Limited fully coupling approach in wind-wave studies (Wu et al., 2019)
- **Traditional atmosphere, ocean, wave models run independently**
	- the impact of surface waves on air-sea interaction processes is often ignored since the temporal and spatial scales of surface waves are much smaller than the atmospheric and oceanic dynamic scales (Hasselmann, 1991)
	- Energy and momentum fluxes do not fully account for the impact of the oceanic wave field at the air-sea interface
- **Inclusion of wave effects have been proved to improves the model performance** compare to the stand alone circulation model
	- (Wu et al., 2019) concludes that the inclusion of waves improves the model performance in terms of sea level height, temperature and circulation
- However, these studies coupled wave to ocean OR atmosphere circulation model only, not the fully atmosphere-ocean-wave coupling
### Why studies different impact from waves?
- There’re complex interactions between these wave effects. 
	- For example, (Wu et al., 2019) founded that the stokes drift advection could largely counters the effect of the Coriolis-Stokes Force on ocean circulation. But two effects do not always cancel entirely, as seen for the SST and associated coastal upwelling in Baltic Sea.
- Thus, consistently introduce these wave effects together and investigate their relative contributions is important. 
### Why Southeast Pacific? 
- The Southern Ocean is the generation source for swells influencing the wave climate of the Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Oceans (Casas-Prat et al., 2024)
- Both Southern Ocean and Southeast Pacific exhibits robust evidence for historical and projected changes in wind-wave characteristics (Casas-Prat et al., 2024)
