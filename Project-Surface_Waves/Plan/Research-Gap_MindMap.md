# Research Gap
## Main Gap
**“Poorly quantified surface wave effects and their relative importance in the modification of air-sea interactions in Southeast Pacific Upwelling System”**
### Sub Gaps:
- What’s the relative contribution from local wind pattern (local wave), comparing to the contributions from Swells (remote wave)
	- Southern Ocean, characterised by strong winds and significant wave-climate, will be the major source of remote waves
- What’s the relative role of each wave-effects in wave-upwelling coupling?
- What’s 
 
### Considered Wave Effects
Wave effects we anticipate to investigate
- momentum flux (wind/wave stress)
- Stokes drift related effects (e.g., Langmuir Turbulence, Stokes-Coriolis force, advection by Stokes drift)
- surface roughness 
	- might change heat fluxes, momentum flux, in the atmophere 

## Background
“The surface wave influence on the upwelling has rarely been investigated in previous studies.” (Wu et al., 2019, p. 9) 
### Why Southeast Pacific? 
- The **Southeast Pacific** presents a compelling region for investigating the effects of surface waves on air-sea interactions due to its complex and dynamically changing wave climate. 
- The **equatorial tropical regions** are characterised by a **complex multimodal wave climate**, driven by the interaction of **remotely generated swells**—primarily the dominant **Southern Ocean generated swell**—and **higher-frequency waves generated by prevailing trade winds**. This complexity results in a high annual mean wave period that exceeds 10 s in this area. 
- Historically, the broader **South Pacific** region has shown evidence of **significant positive trends** in high-frequency significant wave height ($H_s$) extremes (90th percentile), with increases ranging from **$0.5$ to $1 \text{ cm } \text{yr}^{-1}$**.
- Furthermore, this region is projected to experience one of the most significant climate changes in its wave field, with the **mean wave height** ($H_s$) projected to **rise by 5–10% by 2100**. This makes the Southeast Pacific a critical and sensitive area to quantify the present and future relative importance of surface wave effects in the modification of local air-sea heat, momentum, and gas fluxes.

### Why upwelling systems?
- The Foundation: Upwelling is largely Driven by Wind Stress.
	- Since the rate and intensity of upwelling are directly proportional to the magnitude of the initial **wind stress ($\tau$)} and the subsequent **Ekman currents**, any process that modifies either of these is critical to model accurately.
	- Surface waves modify momentum/tracer fluxes in the air-sea interface. Its corresponding wave effect is therefore has large potential to influence the simulation of upwelling systems
		- “In addition, waves can significantly affect momentum flux in the coastal areas affected by coastal upwelling” (Wu et al., 2022, p. 1492) 
- The Flaw in traditional models
	- the impact of surface waves on air-sea interaction processes is often ignored
	- limited coupling between atmosphere, and ocean oversimplify the important role of surface waves, which act as intermediate reservoir for momentum and energy

### General Role of Surface Waves in Air-Sea Interaction (Wu et al., 2022)
Ocean surface gravity waves (**waves**) play a critical and complex role in air-sea interaction, which is fundamental to weather and climate through the exchange of momentum, energy, and mass.
- **Momentum Flux Buffering:** Waves significantly alter the wind stress, which is the momentum flux, across the interface2222. Waves act as a **buffering role** in the transfer of energy and momentum and **redistribute** these fluxes both in time and space3.
- **Decoupling of Stress:** The presence of waves means the **ocean-side stress** ($\tau_{oc}$), which drives ocean circulation and dynamics, is often **not identical** to the **air-side stress** ($\tau_{a}$), which is the momentum flux lost from the atmosphere44. Waves can alter both the **magnitude and direction** of the stress transferred to the ocean555.
- **TKE Generation:** **Wave breaking** is the primary mechanism that enhances the **Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) dissipation rate** in the near-surface layer6. The resulting breaking-induced TKE flux can significantly affect key ocean variables, including **sea surface temperature (SST)** and **surface currents**.
#### Relevance to the Southeast Pacific Upwelling System
- **Coastal Dynamics:** The redistributive role of waves in stress becomes **more significant closer to coasts** due to strong wind gradients13131313.
- **Upwelling Sensitivity:** Coastal **upwelling** is determined by the **ocean-side stress ($\tau_{oc}$), not the air-side stress ($\tau_{a}$)**14. Therefore, waves can **significantly alter** the momentum flux and, consequently, **coastal upwelling**15.
- **Need for Further Study:** The redistributive role of the sea state on **coastal upwelling** and climate simulations **needs to be investigated further**16.


### Traditional Model Limitations (Wu et al., 2019)
- **Traditional atmosphere, ocean, wave models run independently**
	- the impact of surface waves on air-sea interaction processes is often ignored since the temporal and spatial scales of surface waves are much smaller than the atmospheric and oceanic dynamic scales (Hasselmann, 1991)
	- Energy and momentum fluxes do not fully account for the impact of the oceanic wave field at the air-sea interface
- **Invalid Core Assumption:** In traditional atmosphere, ocean, and coupled models, the momentum flux to the ocean interior ($\tau_{oc}$) is commonly **assumed to be identical** to the momentum flux lost from the atmosphere ($\tau_{a}$). This assumption is **invalid** under non-equilibrium conditions, such as **growing and decaying waves** and in **fetch-limited conditions**.
- **Neglected Wave Dynamics:** The wave-induced alteration of stress magnitude and, particularly, the **directional difference** between $\tau_{oc}$ and $\tau_{a}$ are **rarely considered** in coupled climate and forecast models.
- **Poorly Quantified TKE:** TKE flux is often parameterised as a function of surface friction velocity when a wave model is unavailable. This traditional parameterisation is generally **not adequate** under the non-equilibrium sea states (growing and decaying waves) that are common over the open ocean12.
- **Inclusion of wave effects have been proved to improves the model performance** compare to the stand alone circulation model
	- (Wu et al., 2019) concludes that the inclusion of waves improves the model performance in terms of sea level height, temperature and circulation
	- But in Wu et al., 2019, the ocean model is forced by wave model. there’s no coupling between atmosphere, wave and ocean, no feedback from the wave field to the atmosphere, no feedback from the ocean interior to the wave field

Both Wu’s studies do not consider the contribution from Stokes drift to the TKE equation (or Langmuir Turbulence in general), which is not small enough to ignore. 
- The Stokes production of TKE occurs when the **turbulent Reynolds stresses** in the oceanic mixed layer interact with the **vertical shear of the Stokes drift velocity** (the wave-induced Lagrangian current). This interaction extracts energy directly from the surface waves and injects it into the turbulence of the upper ocean 
- Studies have demonstrated that the magnitude of Stokes production of TKE can be **of the same order as the conventional shear production** (i.e., TKE generated by the shear of the mean Eulerian current).


### Why studies different impact from waves?
- There’re complex interactions between these wave effects. 
	- For example, (Wu et al., 2019) founded that the stokes drift advection could largely counters the effect of the Coriolis-Stokes Force on ocean circulation. But two effects do not always cancel entirely, as seen for the SST and associated coastal upwelling in Baltic Sea.
- Thus, consistently introduce these wave effects together and investigate their relative contributions is important. 


### The use of ICON-wave
- The **ICON-Wave** is a fully coupled wave model with the new energetically consistent coupling wave approach that can be applied in both intermediate (e.g., CMIP-type models) and high-resolution (5 km ocean, 5km or 10 km atmosphere coupled) configuration.
- It provides the opportunity to investiagte the wave-effects in an atmosphere-ocean-wave energetically consistent fully coupling.
