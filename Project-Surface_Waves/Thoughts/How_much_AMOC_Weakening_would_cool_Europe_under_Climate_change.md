Note taking from the Seminar presentation given by #presenter/Eduardo_Asenjo and #presenter/Felix_Schaumann

## Questions
- To what extent?
- Underlying evidence of AMOC weakening?
- spatial patterns? Other locations in EU general?
- how does AMOC-related cooling interact with global warming??
## Existing evidence

- from highly idealised experiments (i.e, freshwater hosing)
- many do the forcing under PI background, not under global warming scenarios?
    - Maybe combine freshwater hosing + global warming (increasing CO2)?
## Focus of the study

- Concrete impacts of a given amount of AMOC weakening;
- **transient** effects until 2100
- Coherent modelling framework: across T, AMOC strength
- **How much AMOC will cause the EU to cooling?**
## Modelling framework

- MPI-ESM1.2-LR, ensemble members
- Greenland hosing with diff. magnitude and ways (linear increasing hosing, or one-time hosing)
- also do different GW scenario (SSPxx)
## Result

- wide range of AMOC strength and SST anomaly over Europe for different configurations
- the correlation between the magnitude in EU mean cooling and AMOC weakening:
    - Approximately linear
    - The linear relationship is scenario independent!! (SSP xx)
        - but ofc, higher CO2 emission, the mean T will still get to higher in EU, but the linear relationship persist
- Beyond EU mean T change?
    - net cooling: cooling per 1 Sv AMOC weakening subtracting the surface warming under SSP1.26 scenario
    - e.g., in Hamburg: to deviate the T increase under SSP1.26 in Hamburg at 2100, we need the AMOC to weak 3.1 Sv
- Net cooling this century is possible in large parts of Europe (if AMOC weakens xx%); Especially under low-emission scenarios
- **However, still highly unrealistic** (as the hosing experiments are not coupled to the GCMs)
    - But the idea is to generate an range for effects of AMOC to the EU mean T
## Other paper’s perspective

- The results shows how GW will deviate the cooling effect from a weakening AMOC towards the EU (compare to Jackson et al., 2024)
- Other papers usually do the hosing experiment under PI condition; And they aiming at few centuries afterwards → more equilibrium effects involved
